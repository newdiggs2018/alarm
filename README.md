# Raspberry Pi Texting Alarm Notifier
This should be considered a fun project and not an officially reliable way of securing or monitoring your property.  

Pi running Raspian, Python version 2.7.9.  

This is a modification of the project featured in the YouTube video listed below.  It shows my modified code which triggers from an alarm unit sending a signal voltage (from "bell" output) to a Pi GPIO pin as opposed to that pin sensing ground when triggered by a magnetic door switch.  It then sends a text message to your cell phone from your email account.  This should work with any alarm system that puts out a "bell" signal voltage...after you regulate that voltage to 3v for the PI input.  I am using this automatic texting with a DSC Impassa security system that was already installed in the home I purchased. 

My version of the project will be featured in a YouTube video as well. Coming soon. It has additional information like how to create a desktop icon on the Pi to start the script, and how to view, run, and stop the script from your cell phone.  It also shows the physical installation on a DSC Impassa security system. 

*Note*  This is where I got the code that I modified:
