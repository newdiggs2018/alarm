# Raspberry Pi Texting Alarm Notifier
This is still in progress...and untested...results coming soon.
This is a modification of the project featured in the YouTube video below.  It shows my modified code which triggers from an alarm unit sending a signal voltage (from "bell" output) to a Pi GPIO pin as apposed to that pin sensing ground when triggered by a magnetic door switch.  This should work with any alarm system that puts out a "bell" signal voltage...after you regulate that voltage to 3v for the PI input.  I am using this automatic texting with a DSC Impassa security system that was already installed in the home I purchased. 

My version of the project will be featured in a YouTube video as well. Coming soon.
